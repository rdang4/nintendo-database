# Data Join - Methodology
If I were to describe what a table join is in SQL; it allows us to combine multiple information from tables together. In this query below, I will be using **INNER JOINS** which only produces a set of records present in the tables being joined. **In this case our tables will be: game, game_category, genre, developer, game_developer, publisher, and game_publisher.** Here is a diagram of how inner joins work:

## **Table Join**
With our hard work done, I am now able to join all the tables together to create a clean chart for me to view.

```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS joined_dataset;

CREATE TEMP TABLE joined_dataset AS
SELECT game.game_id, game.title, genre.genre_id, genre.name AS genre_name,
	   game.esrb, game.metascore, game.user_score, publisher.name AS publisher_name, 
	   developer.name AS developer_name
FROM game

INNER JOIN game_category
	ON game.game_id = game_category.game_id
INNER JOIN genre
	ON game_category.genre_id = genre.genre_id
INNER JOIN game_developer
	ON game.game_id = game_developer.game_id
INNER JOIN developer
	ON game_developer.developer_id = developer.developer_id
INNER JOIN game_publisher
	ON game.game_id = game_publisher.game_id
INNER JOIN publisher
	ON game_publisher.publisher_id = publisher.publisher_id;
	
SELECT * FROM joined_dataset
WHERE metascore IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY metascore DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
<br />

âœ… **Result:**
|game_id |title                                                      |genre_id |genre_name          |esrb |metascore|user_score|publisher_name   |developer_name        |
