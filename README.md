## Introduction 📝
This is a personal project that explores the entirety of Nintendo Games Library. Therefore, these games will only involve consoles that are developed by Nintendo exclusively. I will be documenting each video game along with information related to it. What I want to get out of this project is:
  * To apply my knowledge acquired during formal education.
  * To showcase my skills in being able to mine, create, then visualize large amounts of data.
  * To see how far I can take my skills in using SQL and other softwares such as Tableau and STATA.
  * Which games sold the most units? Does ESRB rating affect the amount of sales? Which genre is the most popular? (Will get more specific later).

>	As we head into the next year of gaming, I wanted to know how the gaming industry was doing and what type of games were being released in 2024. I usually take note of a few upcoming games and wishlist old ones just in case they go on sale. I remember talking about this to my friends at the time, and funny enough, the YouTube algorithm decided to hit me with a [video about 2023 being “a bad year for gaming”](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/evknEWzEBaQ). Upon further research, we have seen more than 6000 estimated jobs affected since the start of the year. The highest number of workers affected was from Unity, which was evident due to the recent pricing changes on their platform. [The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/10/02/technology/how-a-pricing-change-led-to-a-revolt-by-unitys-video-game-developers.html#:~:text=Trip%20Hawkins%2C%20the%20founder%20of,ever%20pounded%20into%20a%20wall.) quoted Trip Hawkins, the founder of Electronic Arts, as saying, "It's like a hardware store selling a carpenter a hammer and nails and then charging a fee for every nail the carpenter has ever pounded into a wall." This puts into perspective how unfair it can be for small companies/game devs that make a living off of creating games. Rather than pay a licensing fee for the overall use of Unity, they are forced to pay a fee for each sale made from their games.

>	I wanted to share my findings and bring this to light on how significant changes from big companies can negatively affect the lives of hard working game developers and employees. Although it is difficult to hear about major company decisions and recent layoffs, that is not the main focus of this project. If you would like more information about this, I suggest taking a look at the videos, articles, and statistics in the [citations](#citations-).
