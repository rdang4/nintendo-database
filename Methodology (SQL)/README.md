## Table Relationships
The brainstorming process was unfamiliar to me as I needed to determine how to arrange each column to be inserted into a table. I decided to create a workflow diagram to visualize each and every table that was going to be created. You never know how much writing or visualizing your ideas helps until it is done!

Each table is labeled from 1 to 7 to show the relationship between each dataset. Table 1 begins with **```Nintendo.genre```** and ends with Table 7 as **```Nintendo.publisher```**.

Relationships between each dataset is shown below:

## Key Data Terms
If I would like to answer my questions, I needed to figure out which data terms were going to be used in my query:

* **```genre.name```**: To name the top 3 genres
* **```game_count```**: How many game titles are within these genres?
* **```average_rating```**: Identifying the top 3 genres based on the average rating on Metacritic
* **```developer.name```**: Finding the top 3 genres published by Nintendo
* **```game.title```**: To find the most popular game titles

<br />

* **```game.esrb```**: Identifying the ESRB ratings from the game table
* **```game.sales_mil```**: Identifying the amount of sales depending on the ESRB
* **```sum_sales_mil```**: Comparing the amount of sales based on each ESRB rating

<br />

* **```average_comparison```**: Comparing how many more games were released in the top genre compared to the third top genre
* **```percentage```**: Calculated percentage of games released in the top genre compared to all other games

---
## Start to End Points
To be able to get to the **top 3 genres by a developer**, I need to create a dataset that can get from **```genre.name```** to **```developer.name```**. Therefore, in order to achieve this result, I need to find a way to connect **Table 1** **```Nintendo.genre```** all the way to **Table 5** **```Nintendo.developer```**.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://github.com/rdang4/nintendo-database-analytics/blob/main/Images/ND_Mind_Map_1.png" width=100% height=100%>
</p>

Additionally, I would be able to calculate the **```game_count```** based on the **```genre_id```** by referencing the **```game_category```** database. Every other question can also stem from the first or answered with the **```Nintendo.game```** table.

<br />

In order to start from **```Nintendo.genre```** and end at **```Nintendo.developer```** we need to find the foreign keys to join each table together.

|Table Join       |Begin               |End                 |Foreign Key       |
|-----------------|--------------------|--------------------|------------------|
|**Part 1**       |```genre```         |```game_category``` |```genre_id```    |
|**Part 2**       |```game_category``` |```game```          |```game_id```     |
|**Part 3**       |```game```          |```game_developer```|```game_id```     |
|**Part 4**       |```game_developer```|```developer```     |```developer_id```|

<br />

This resulting table join will give us our SQL output. To help me visualize it even further, I decided to split this into different steps:

## Table Creation
### a. Genre
Now we can get started in the creation of each database! Since I am starting from scratch, I cannot begin answering each question until I am done entering all the game titles from the Metacritic website. Let's start with the easy part; the **```Nintendo.genre```** database.

The idea is pretty much the same when creating the others. Here is what I had for **```genre```**:

 <br /> 

```sql
CREATE TABLE genre
(
  genre_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
  last_update TIMESTAMP NOT NULL
);
```

 <br /> 

Now we get to add in the genres listed on the Metacritic site! I was able to find 44 genre names listed under the filter search. Since **```genre.id```** is a **SERIAL PRIMARY KEY**, every time I insert a row into the database, the **```genre.id```** will continuously count up for each update. 

> (There are a lot of games that are not within these genre names. I do not understand why, but I will do my best to associate each game in respect to the closest genre name.)

I will list the first **5 genre names** here:

 <br />

```sql
INSERT INTO genre(name, last_update)
VALUES
  ('Action', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),
  ('Action Adventure', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),
  ('Action Puzzle', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),
  ('Action RPG', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),
  ('Adventure', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);
```
```sql
SELECT * FROM genre
LIMIT 5;
```
‚úÖ **Result:**
|genre_id|name            |last_update               |
|--------|----------------|--------------------------|
|1       |Action          |2023-11-14 00:29:30.420746|
|2       |Action Adventure|2023-11-14 00:29:30.420746|
|3       |Action Puzzle   |2023-11-14 00:29:30.420746|
|4       |Action RPG      |2023-11-14 00:29:30.420746|
|5       |Adventure       |2023-11-14 00:29:30.420746|

 <br />
 
### üü• **Problems/Hiccups**:

As I was entering the values for **```genre.name```**, I noticed a problem. There are some genres that included apostrophes within their names, and naturally, this would mean it would close the character strings when entering values. Take the name ***Beat-'Em Up*** for example:

<br />
 
```sql
INSERT INTO genre(name, last_update)
VALUES
  ('Beat-'Em Up', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),
```

 <br />
 
As shown above, the name ***‚ÄúBeat-‚ÄôEm-Up‚Äù*** technically ends the character entry at ***‚ÄúBeat-‚Äù***. In times like these, I always check for [documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/7.4/functions-string.html). When encasing the name in single quotes, it will become a string. Although, if there is another single quote, it ends the string. Therefore, we must make the apostrophe a **literal string** by using **```\s```** or **```''```** to bypass it:

 <br />
 
```sql
INSERT INTO genre(name, last_update)
VALUES
  ('Beat-''Em Up', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP),
```
‚úÖ **Result:**
|genre_id|name            |last_update               |
|--------|----------------|--------------------------|
|8       |Beat-'Em Up     |2023-11-14 00:29:30.420746|

 <br />

Now it works! **I will not show the creation for the ```developer``` and ```publisher``` database as the overall process is the same**.

---
### b. Game
Now that I have familiarized myself with creating tables and inserting values, I moved on to the biggest one, the **```Nintendo.game```** table.

> The **```Nintendo.game```** database is the table that will take a majority of my time as there are about 1000 games rated on Metacritic. As of right now, I have the first 100 games I entered in the database which is more than enough to explain the process here.

Creating parameters for each column was very important here. I am keeping in mind what I would like to do and am adjusting on the fly. Other than researching which games were released since the start of the Nintendo Switch, the hardest part was inserting all of the titles into the database. As far as I know, there is no simple way to add the values without importing them from Excel or Google Sheets. I wanted to challenge myself by manually adding each game myself. Here is what I came up with:

 <br />
 
```sql
CREATE TABLE game
(
  game_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  title VARCHAR(500) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
  release_date DATE,
  esrb VARCHAR(10),
  console VARCHAR(50),
  metascore SMALLINT,
  user_score NUMERIC(3,1),
  sales_mil NUMERIC(5,3),
  details TEXT
);
```

 <br />

I am very much aware that some smaller games will not have the sales or general information available. To avoid any standard deviations, any games that are not known as well will be entered as **NULL** while the **games that are not rated on Metacritic will not be listed in the database**. **All sales information will be converted to units of a million.** Also, keep in mind that sales information is not readily available (for legal reasons). **Numbers of sales on the Switch console will be rough estimates according to the VGChartz website.** In the process of adding more game titles, there are games that include Skylanders Imaginators, I Am Setsuna, or Metal Slug that are ported from older consoles. I will not include sales information from these games as this project is mainly focused on first party Nintendo Switch games. 

> As of January, I decided to change the way I inserted values into the query below. Rather than individually type in the values I placed a majority of the values into an Excel sheet and used the CONCATENATE function to create the line of code I needed. CONCATENATE allows me to simply copy and paste the line of text into my query and with a few changes here and there, I can achieve the same result as if I were to do it individually. Finding a faster way of doing slow and tedious work is VERY exciting. 

Here is an example of the values I inserted into the database:

 <br />
 
```sql
INSERT INTO game(title, release_date, esrb, console, metascore,
                 user_score, sales_mil)
VALUES
     ('The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild', '2017-03-03', 'E', 'Switch', '97',
      '8.7', '31.15'),
     ('Super Mario Odyssey', '2017-10-27', 'E10+', 'Switch', '97',
      '8.9', '26.95'),
     ('Persona 5 Royal', '2022-10-21', 'M', 'Switch', '94',
      '8.6', '4.0');
```
‚úÖ **Result:**
|game_id |title                                   |release_date|esrb|console|metascore|user_score|sales_mil|
|--------|----------------------------------------|------------|----|-------|---------|----------|---------|
|1       |The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild |2017-03-03  |E   |Switch |97       |8.7       |31.150   |
|2       |Super Mario Odyssey                     |2017-10-27  |E10+|Switch |97       |8.9       |26.950   |
|3       |Persona 5 Royal                         |2022-10-21  |M   |Switch |94       |8.6       |4.000    |

 <br />

> I added another column called **```details```**, but I took it out to shorten the chart a bit.

<br />

### üü• **Problems/Hiccups**:

There were a couple problems I encountered during this process:

* The **```TO_DATE```** function. I preferred showing the name of the month followed by the number of day and then the year. I did learn afterward that it was probably better to store dates in a dedicated **```DATE```** column. For example: **"2017-03-03"** compared to **"Mar-03-2017"**. A lot of trial and error, but I settled with the default format.
* Initially when creating the **```Nintendo.game```** table, I set the parameters for each column to be **```VARCHAR```**. This made no sense as scores and sale numbers are considered to be numerical integers. I made the changes accordingly.

<br />

---
### c. Game Category Table

Moving on to the **```game_category```** database (which I would like to call the middle-man), I needed to find a way to transfer all the values of **```game_id```** from **```Nintendo.game```** into this table. This was so I could avoid having to individually type the same numbers. I took into consideration how I am able to continuously add more *game ids* into the table because new game titles will eventually be added into **```Nintendo.game```**. Therefore, a new unique **```game_id```** would be inserted into **```game_category```**.

For each **```game_id```** listed in the **```Nintendo.game```** table, the **```genre_id```** will be assigned to it. **This would mean that we will have multiple *game ids* that have the same *genre*.** First, lets start with the table creation:

 <br />
 
```sql
CREATE TABLE game_category
(
  game_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  genre_id SMALLINT,
  last_update TIMESTAMP
);
```

 <br />

Now, let's add the **```game_id```** column from **```Nintendo.game```**:

 <br />
 
```sql
INSERT INTO game_category (game_id)
SELECT game.game_id
FROM game
WHERE game.game_id NOT IN (SELECT game_id FROM game_category);
```

 <br />

### üü• **Problems/Hiccups**:

My first thought was that I wanted to understand whether or not I was able to transfer the primary key **```game_id```** from **```Nintendo.game```** into **```game_category```**. This was my first shot at it:

 <br />
 
```sql
INSERT INTO game_category (game_id)
SELECT game_id
FROM game;
```
> The problem was that if this query was being used, it would not account for the duplicate **```game_id```** being transferred. If primary key for **```game_id```** number 1 was already transferred, it cannot be done again. Therefore, I had to find a way to select the values that are not already in **```game_category```** for the output to run. Hence, the original query was made above.

 <br />


Lastly, I need to **update every **```genre_id```** to each respective **```game_id```**.** This was a very tedious process as I am constantly going back and forth between windows to find the genres. I noted every new game I entered down on a Notepad window and typed down their genre names. Unless there is a better way of updating values, I went with this for example:

> I found a way to cancel the query if there is already a **```genre_id```** with a value **OR** a **```genre_id```** that is not the listed ID number. I decided to add in the **5th line below** to check for filled values.


<br />
 
```sql
UPDATE game_category
SET genre_id = 5,
    last_update = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
WHERE game_id IN (108,111,112,135,139)
    AND (genre_id IS NULL OR genre_id != 33);  
```
> **```genre_id```** = 5 in this case refers to the name **Adventure** as noted under [Table Creation](#table-creation). Basically setting each **```game_id```** mentioned within the parenthesis with the genre name **Adventure**.

<br />


I used **INNER JOIN** to output tables associated with the game and genre table to check how my table was looking so far. I am glad to say that it works!!

<br />
 
```sql
SELECT game.game_id, game.title, genre.genre_id, genre.name, game.esrb FROM game
INNER JOIN game_category
  ON game.game_id = game_category.game_id
INNER JOIN genre
  ON game_category.genre_id = genre.genre_id
ORDER BY game_id
LIMIT 10;
```
‚úÖ **Result:**
|game_id |title                                   |genre_id |name           |esrb |
|--------|----------------------------------------|---------|---------------|-----|
|1       |Fast RMX                                |25       |Racing         |E    |

|10      |The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild |19       |Open-World     |E10+ |

<br />


> I was able to select the columns that I wanted to be outputted, **INNER JOIN ```game_category```** because of **```game_id```**, and **INNER JOIN ```genre```** because of **```genre_id```**.

## Questions and Answers

I will be sure to provide a full SQL documentation in a seperate file for those that just want to see the bulk of code rather than read through such a SUEPR big wall of text. I treated this like a "research" project paper I have always done in school, so it is always nice to go back and reapply what I did in other projects. On to the questions! I wanted to emulate a bunch of questions that could be asked by a company

<br />

### ‚ùï Question 1

**What are the top 3 genres of all games published by Nintendo?**

When deciding on what important identifiers are going to be used in this case, I went back to the [Table Relationships](#table-relationships) section to see what I can implement. The most important part of this question was to generate the **```genre_count```** of all genres and out of all of them, only **display games that were published by Nintendo**.

Specifically, I will have to:

> INNER JOIN the **game_category** and **genre** tables with the **publisher** and **game_publisher** table in order to match each **```genre_id```** to its publisher. Afterwards, I will be able to narrow the results according to Nintendo.

<br />
 
```sql
SELECT game.game_id, game.title, game.esrb, game.metascore, game.user_score,
	   game_publisher.publisher_id, publisher.name, genre.genre_id, genre.name 
	   FROM game

INNER JOIN game_category
	ON game.game_id = game_category.game_id
INNER JOIN genre
	ON game_category.genre_id = genre.genre_id
INNER JOIN game_publisher
	ON game.game_id = game_publisher.game_id
INNER JOIN publisher
	ON game_publisher.publisher_id = publisher.publisher_id

WHERE publisher.name = 'Nintendo'
ORDER BY game_id;  
```
> With all the tables inner joined, I am now able to see the result of all games released by Nintendo specifically. I can fully visualize all the information laid in front of me. We will now move on to the **top 3 genres** where I will be creating **```genre_count```**.

```sql
SELECT genre.genre_id, genre.name,
	   COUNT (*) AS genre_count
	   FROM game

INNER JOIN game_category
	ON game.game_id = game_category.game_id
INNER JOIN genre
	ON game_category.genre_id = genre.genre_id
INNER JOIN game_publisher
	ON game.game_id = game_publisher.game_id
INNER JOIN publisher
	ON game_publisher.publisher_id = publisher.publisher_id

WHERE publisher.name = 'Nintendo'
GROUP BY publisher, genre.genre_id
ORDER BY genre_count DESC
LIMIT 5;  
```
> We select **genre_id** and **name** from the genre table and the count of every genre which will be named **```genre_count```**. It is important to specify **Nintendo** using the **WHERE** clause from the **publisher table** in order to count those rows. Then group **publishers** and **genre_id** which leads to my result:

‚úÖ **Result:**
|genre_id|name            |genre_count|
|--------|----------------|-----------|
|22      |Platformer      |10         |
|24      |RPG             |7          |
|19      |Open-World      |6          |
|2       |Action Adventure|5          |
|4       |Action RPG      |5          |

<br />

There is our answer for Question 1! **The top 3 genres published by Nintendo are Platformers, RPG's, and Open-World titles.** Before diving into this question, it was pretty obvious to me that Nintendo's popular genres involved platforming. We have multiple series that became classics like Super Mario Bros., Kirby, Metroid, Yoshi, and more.

<br />

### ‚ùï Question 2

**Which games are the most popular out of those 3 genres?**

So our next question tasks us with finding a more specific result out of the output from Question 1. Rather than look through and count all games published by Nintendo again, I have already found the top 3 genres: Platformer, RPG, and Open-World. 

We can interpret this question multiple different ways:

> We can use the Metacritic ratings, user scores, or game sales to find the most popular games. Since there is no accurate way of finding ALL game sales on the market, I will omit this from my findings. I decided to go with both ratings as the user scores represent the game audience while Metacritic scores is solely based on the opinions of the team associated with the website.

I reused the same query as Question 1 but with a few tweaks to better represent this question:

<br />
 
```sql
SELECT game.title, game.metascore FROM game

INNER JOIN game_category
	ON game.game_id = game_category.game_id
INNER JOIN genre
	ON game_category.genre_id = genre.genre_id
INNER JOIN game_publisher
	ON game.game_id = game_publisher.game_id
INNER JOIN publisher
	ON game_publisher.publisher_id = publisher.publisher_id

WHERE publisher.name = 'Nintendo' 
AND genre.name = 'Platformer'

ORDER BY metascore DESC;
```
> Since the question asks for the most popular games, the most important columns to use will be **game.title** and **game.metascore** from the game table. This is **part 1** of the question.

‚úÖ **Result:**
|title                               |genre_count |
|------------------------------------|------------|
|Super Mario Odyssey                 |97          |
|Super Mario Bros. Wonder            |92          |
|Super Mario 3D World + Bowser's Fury|89          |
|Metroid Dread			     |88          |
|Super Mario Maker 2      	     |88          |
|Donkey Kong Country: Tropical Freeze|86          |
|Kirby and the Forgotten Land        |85          |
|New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe      |80          |
|Yoshie's Crafted World      	     |79          |
|Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe |79          |
